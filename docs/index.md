## Vision
DELIB | The Institute for Deliberative Democracy research group is developing systems and methods out of a desire to bring people and opinions closer, to function as group while keeping memebers individuality. 

### The instituteâ€™s activities are carried out on three levels.
1. Deliberation research and theory.
2. Devising effective methods.
3. Developing software. 

## Mission
To generate expressive tools for Political Discourse in communities.
Facilitate and Guide Decentralized Decision Making expressed in the interface and group norms. 
Research and Develop Organic Models of Communication in Social Contexts.
Help groups to self determine and become significant social force. 
Promote political agendas of groups with organic flow. 
## Open Source and distributed technology
We believe in distributed and open source code, and give it a priority. 
We believe that sustainable commercial entrepreneurship is best achieved by Open Source initiatives and collaboration practices. 

We cherish transparency in production as well as in distribution. And beyond.
However, still today few partners, as a factor for their social growth, require the development and usage of institutional code modules in closed code with payment systems. In such cases we still collaborate and provide instruction for as long as the knowledge generated from the closed models remains available to the public.

## Experiments

 We strive to generate and engage in decision making and social activity in order to gain experience essential to the development of our models and technology to be reflected at every level of the practical code.
 
## Methods for experimental developments
In the research phases, the Institute's staff promotes independent research and software on any technology of personal interest, and methods that are suitable for the institute to create a research base and experimental infrastructure which later on is implemented in joint development using the common technology agreed upon its members.
