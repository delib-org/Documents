The Institute for Deliberative Democracy research group is developing systems and methods out of a desire to bring people and opinions closer, to function as group while keeping their individuality.
The institute's activities are carried out on three levels.

 1. Deliberation research and theory.
 2. Devising effective methods.
 3. Developing software.
